# Normal Cost Calculation for Retirement Pension  

This project calculates the **Normal Cost** for a retirement pension plan. Normal Cost represents the annual cost assigned to an employer for funding the benefits accrued by employees during a specific year. It is a key component in actuarial valuations of pension plans.

## **Objective**  
1. Calculate the Normal Cost for a defined retirement pension plan.  
2. Automate the calculation process to improve accuracy and efficiency.  

---

## **Key Features**  
- **Valuation of Benefits:**  
  Calculates the present value of benefits accrued in a given year for each employee.  
- **Actuarial Assumptions:**  
  Incorporates assumptions such as interest rates, salary growth, mortality rates, and retirement age.  
- **Automation:**  
  Automates the calculation process using Python to reduce manual work and minimize errors.  

---

## **Methodology**  
1. Determine the Present Value of Future Benefits (PVFB) for each employee.  
2. Allocate the PVFB over the employee's working lifetime using an actuarial cost method (e.g., Entry Age Normal or Projected Unit Credit).  
3. Calculate the Normal Cost:

## **Files**  
- `normal_cost.py`: Python script for automating Normal Cost calculations.  
- `pension_data.xlsx`: Input data, including employee demographics, salary details, and assumptions.  

---

## **Tools**  
- **Python:** For automating calculations using libraries like pandas and numpy.

## **Results**  
The project successfully:  
1. Automated the Normal Cost calculation for a retirement pension plan.  
2. Delivered accurate, scalable calculations adaptable to various actuarial assumptions.

## **How to Use**  
1. Clone the repository and download the files (`normal_cost.py`, `pension_data.xlsx`).  
2. Ensure Python and necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy) are installed.  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash  
   python normal_cost.py  
   ```
